# Espresso-Project-Management-Tool
In today’s world of software development where more and more emphasis is given to collaboration, teams of large sizes are finding it difficult to be productive. 
This problem arises due to the lack of communication and project management. 
As a solution to this problem, I propose to develop a project management tool that would help the teams to be more efficient and productive with their time.
The final project will display a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to the user where he’ll be provided the controls to:
Create a board for a specific project, Creating a task which includes : Adding a new name for it, Adding a person responsible to complete the task, Adding the current status of the task, Setting the priority for the task, Giving a deadline to a particular task.
Log – Any changes made with respect to a particular task will show up here 
Question and answer section specific to boards
Analysis: 
This will be done with the help of graphs which will show the overall completion of the project, modules which require work, etc.
